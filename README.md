# Sparkletilt Cat
This project is being made for OnBoard, and since I'm basically a hardware noob, I'm using this Jam: https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/sparkletilt-pcb. I'm going to change it up and make it my own by turning it into a cat!

Right now its still a work in progress, so there's not much info for me to add, but here's a picture of what it looks like so far!
